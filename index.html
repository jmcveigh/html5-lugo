              <p class="flow-text">
                Linux is an option, akin to the Microsoft stream as well as the Apple stream.  Linux is symbolic of the Libre stream.  The Libre stream is a collection of software, specifications and ideals continually adapted by Google and Mozilla, to become a dazzling third choice for digital software products.
              </p>
              <p class="flow-text">
                  The Linux operating system originated as a micro-kernel UNIX work-alike, created by Linus Torvald.  This operating system was built for the IBM PC and IBM compatible computers.  This source code of this operating system was distributed, freely, using digital computer telephone modem BBS, digital email as well as public access Internet newsgroups.
              </p>
              <p class="flow-text">
                  The Linux kernel had been written in the C programming language with a dash of Assembler  The C programming language, created by Kenrick and Ritchie, commonly referred to as K &amp; R C,  was standardized by ANSI then ported to the Linux operating system as it's first killer-app! The filesystem was intended to become POSIX compliant then the UNIX binutils were introduced.  This includes the ability to move, rename, copy, remove, create both symbolic and hard links (short-cuts), traverse folder hierarchies, recursive processing, statistics and metrics of a file, searching for files, searching through files, storage utilities with much more.  Popular text editors such as Nano, Pico, VI and EMACS were ported to the operating system.  Then an email client, known as Pine, was ported permitting users to network from within the Linux operating system.  Eventually, XFree86 was born -- a work alike of the popular UNIX server, X. Window managers, such as FVWM95 and Enlightenment with user-interface toolkits including Motif work-alikes were brought to the system.  Soon Netscape ported their popular web browser creating a fully functional web terminal.  Scientific, math and medical applications, HAM radio, network services and clients and some classic video games were created entirely for the Linux operating system.
              </p>
              <p class="flow-text">
                  In it's current instance, there is a huge variety of software support.  This includes : Steam, Opera, Evolution, Skype, Empathy, GIMP, Inkscape, LMMS and Audacity!  Fast adoption of commercial products due to the availability of Steam will popularize Linux as a functional, classic and modern computer operating system.  The new open source initiative by Microsoft, in the upcoming years, will permit dazzling displays of prowress including the Windows Universal Experience from the Linux operating system.
              </p>
              <p class="flow-text">
                Linus Torvald, proud of his work, discussed and distributed, with freedom, the Linux kernel in hopes of receiving user-contributions of cource-code as well as time.  Linux was toughted as a UNIX work-alike.  This operating system is POSIX compliant in storage, system routines and procedures.  It contains the GNU instance of the popular UNIX command-line tools.  Linux has been ported to every major chipset and hardware platform.  There is support for an enourmous variety of peripherals.  Through a blossoming community, user-contributions of source code as well as time and a lot of hard work by Linus Torvald, Linux has grown from a kernel to proper operating system and digital computing platform.

              <h5 class="light teal-text text-accent-4">Free software</h5>
              <p class="flow-text">
                A pro-bono legal team, working closely with advocates of the Linux operating system developed the <abbr title="Free Software Foundation">FSF</abbr> and, with a resource library of the popular UNIX command-line tools, GNU was created.  This legal team drafted the original instance of the GNU General Public License, which was revolutionary in digital computing technology.  The GNU General Public License permitted software to grow with user-contributions.
              </p>
              <p class="flow-text">
                  Soon after the GNU General Public License proved sound, the Open Source initiative surged through the wires of the world as household names such as: Corel, id Software, Netscape and Apple joined in.  Free software developed through user and corporate contributions are at the heart of the Linux community.
              </p>
              <p class="flow-text">
                  The idea, commonly, is that the software is <i>free as in beer</i>.  This is where a person or corporate entity will donate to the open source movement of a particular software endeavor in hopes of stiring further development.  The person or corporate entity will prune, shape or grow the software to suit their business logic.  Once a problem is solved in their facility, this solution would be freely distributed to other facilities.

              <h5 class="light teal-text text-accent-4">The catch</h5>
              <p class="flow-text">
                Generally, the idea is that software is free for consumers, individuals, charities and discounted for educational institutions but corporations, enterprises, industry and government pay.  Since the software is free for consumers, individuals, charaties and available in educational institutions there will be a wide user base, stiring the software as well as training, community and knowledge sharing.
              </p>
              <p class="flow-text">
                Often, this free software requires an $80.00 <abbr title="Canadian Dollar">CAD</abbr> paper-back book to make it work, a seminar or training course, an individual to form-fit the software to the problem domain or is not considered to be user-friendly.

                Where there are free software solutions for every important digital computing problem of the day; some free software solutions are abandoned, below commercial quality standards or do not suit any problem domain but the author's.

                Community is the Living Water of free software, the Linux operating system and the open source movement.  Many of the members of the community benefit greatly from free software, the Linux operating system and the open source movement and feel so strongly about the ideals of free software to the general public choose to become advocates.  Advocates, such as myself Jason McVeigh (jmcveigh) in Orillia, ON, CA, promote the Linux operating system with Linux user groups such as <abbr title="Linux user group in Orillia, ON, CA">LUGO</abbr>, the Linux user group in Orillia, ON, CA.
